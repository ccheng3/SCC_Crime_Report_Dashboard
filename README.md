# SCC_Crime_Report_Dashboard
Santa Clara County Sheriff Crime Report Data Viz Dashboard

 ### Description: 
 A vanilla JS app that fetches SCC Crime Report data from SCC Open Data API and 
 visualizes the data with a map (Leaflet) and some straight-forward metrics (D3.js). 

 ### Goal: 
 Practice designing and developing a vanilla JS app from scratch in order to practice 
 JS coding skills. 

 ### Purpose: 
 Create an app that I will use for myself to investigate the dataset and learn about 
 SCC crime history from 2018 - present.
