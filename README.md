# SCC_Crime_Report_Dashboard
Santa Clara County Sheriff Crime Report Data Viz Dashboard

Deployed here: https://condescending-torvalds-d3481f.netlify.app

 ### Description: 
 A vanilla JS app that fetches SCC Crime Report data from SCC Open Data API and 
 visualizes the data with a map (Leaflet) and some straight-forward metrics (D3.js). 

 ### Goal: 
 Practice designing and developing a vanilla JS app from scratch in order to practice 
 JS coding skills. 

 ### Purpose: 
 Create an app that I will use for myself to investigate the dataset and learn about 
 SCC crime history from 2018 - present. 

 This project is entirely focused on APPLYING practical coding skills to a hot topic and intensely personal question: What is going on in Santa Clara County? The massive income disparity between wealth-chasing techies and the more occupationally diverse Bay natives has brought push to shove, and now it appears that break-ins and all sorts of theft have become the norm in SCC. Friends in some circles have already pointed out that driving a Tesla equates to basically putting a bright red target on your back. "Hey! I'm wealthy! (Or maybe just broke af and posturing hard...) 

 Can I use the D3 library to help produce some data journalism insights? Well, hopefully. That's the goal. I will definitely report back soon with some initial results - D3 appears to have gained a kind of reputation for being difficult to understand, but maybe that's just noise generated to intimidate new coders from working with the software? Brogrammer elitism at worst, but could also be pure honesty at best...maybe average case is like meh you gain more power but you incur more complexity?
