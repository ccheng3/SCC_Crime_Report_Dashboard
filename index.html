            <h3>A data visualization project using the data driven document library (D3.js) by Mike Bostock and vanilla
                Javascript.</h3>
            <h4>Number of recorded crime incidents to date: <span id="num_incidents_to_date"></span>
            </h4>
            <p>I have removed all of the "Phone Ur Office" datapoints since these do not appear to be crime
                incidents.
                I
                contacted Mr. Ed Bagsik,
                IT manager of Santa Clara County Open Data, for more information on the nature of this incident type -
                but never received a reply.
                <br>
                <br>
                Unfortunately, it appears that the Santa Clara County Open Datasets do not
                include a parameter description document, and the lack of clear documentation is just simply
                frustrating. After all, what could the "Phone Ur Office" incidents be? Would it simply be deputy
                sheriffs calling in to report the start/end of a patrol shift? Or something more urgent, like
                reporting in to confirm being en-route to a 911 call or communicating availability to respond
                to a 911 call?
            </p>
            <p>The Seattle Police department's crime report dataset is much more detailed
                and
                refined in this regard - Seattle PD actually records the latitude and longitudinal
                coordinates of each incident. Massive respect to Seattle PD for putting in that extra effort. </p>

            <h3>Let's first take a look at the frequency distribution of incident reports over a 24 hour period.
            </h3>
            The X-axis tracks the hour of day, while the Y-axis tracks the number of incidents recorded during each
            hour. My initial guess is that there should be less reported incidents during the day, and then a sharp
            increase during the night. I am making the general assumption that the cover of darkness would push more
            criminal activity to occur at night. However, it could just very well stay relatively constant. I wonder
            what the data will say?

            <h3>Sources</h3>
            The data is sourced from the Santa Clara County Open Data Portal. Here is the link to the dataset:
            <a href="https://data.sccgov.org/Public-Safety/Crime-Reports/n9u6-aijz">LINK is Here!</a>
            <br>
            <br>
            An interesting observation of note - this is the most popular dataset that is not COVID-19 related.
            I think two conclusions could be equally likely to be true. Firstly, SCC residents are becoming increasingly
            concerned about rising crime in the County. Or, alternatively, users who don't even live in the County are
            interested
            in seeing what the numbers say in order to justify their pre-conceived political notions about Santa Clara
            County
            or the San Francisco Bay Area in general. Or both, since the two sentiments are not mutually exclusive.
