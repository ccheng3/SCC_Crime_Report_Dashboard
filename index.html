    <h1>The Santa Clara County Sheriff Crime Report Dashboard</h1>
    <h2>Chris Cheng</h2>
    <h3>A data visualization project using the data driven document library (D3.js) by Mike Bostock and vanilla
        Javascript.</h3>
    <h4>Number of recorded crime incidents to date: <span id="num_incidents_to_date"></span>
    </h4>
    <p>I have removed all of the incidents that do not contain a specific address number from the dataset to help ease
        in the mapping of the geographical visualization. Unfortunately, the Santa Clara County Sheriff's department
        does not
        appear to utilize some sort of address standardization, resulting in this problem.</p>
    <p>I do want to point out that the Seattle Police department's crime report dataset is much more detailed and
        refined in this regard - Seattle PD goes even further and actually records the latitude and longitudinal
        coordinates of each incident. Massive respect to Seattle PD for putting in that extra effort. </p>
    <p>I will work with
        what I have in this dataset, but there is a lot left to be desired when comparing this dataset to that of
        Seattle
        PD. Regardless, I am fortunate that this Santa Clara County Crime Report open API even exists in the first
        place. Now let us
        explore this dataset!</p>
