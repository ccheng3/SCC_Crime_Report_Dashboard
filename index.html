        <div class="introduction">
            <h3>A data visualization project using the data driven document library (D3.js) by Mike Bostock and vanilla
                Javascript.</h3>
            <h4>Number of recorded crime incidents to date: <span id="num_incidents_to_date"></span>
            </h4>
            <p>I have removed all of the incidents that do not contain a specific address number from the dataset to
                help
                ease
                in the mapping of the geographical visualization. Unfortunately, the Santa Clara County Sheriff's
                department
                does not
                appear to utilize some sort of address standardization, resulting in this problem.</p>
            <p>I have also removed all of the "Phone Ur Office" datapoints since these do not appear to be crime
                incidents.
                I
                contacted Mr. Ed Bagsik, who is listed as the
                IT manager for Santa Clara County Open Data, but never received a reply. The Santa Clara County
                government
                has a
                track record
                of
                low transparency (see CCW problem), so I'm really not too surprised.
            </p>
            <p>I do want to point out that the Seattle Police department's crime report dataset is much more detailed
                and
                refined in this regard - Seattle PD goes even further and actually records the latitude and longitudinal
                coordinates of each incident. Massive respect to Seattle PD for putting in that extra effort. </p>
