            <h3>A web-based data visualization project powered by the
                Data-Driven Documents
                library (D3.js).</h3>
            <h4>Number of recorded crime incidents to date: <span

            </h4>
            <p>I have removed all of the "Phone Ur Office" datapoints since
                these do not appear to be crime
                incidents.
                <br>
                <br>
                Unfortunately, it appears that the Santa Clara County Open
                Datasets do not
                include a parameter description document, and the lack of clear
                documentation is just simply
                frustrating. After all, what could the "Phone Ur Office"
                incidents be? Would it simply be deputy
                sheriffs calling in to report the start/end of a patrol shift?
                Or something more urgent, like
                reporting in to confirm being en-route to a 911 call or
                communicating availability to respond
                to a 911 call?
            </p>
            <p>The Seattle Police department's crime report dataset is much more
                detailed
                and
                refined in this regard - Seattle PD actually records the
                latitude and longitudinal
                coordinates of each incident. Massive respect to Seattle PD for
                putting in that extra effort. SF and Silicon Valley local
                govt's really need to follow suit and strengthen their Open Data
                practices. </p>

            <h3>Let's first take a look at the frequency distribution of
                incident reports over a 24 hour period.
            </h3>
            <p>The X-axis tracks the hour of day, while the Y-axis tracks the
                number of incidents recorded during each
                hour. My initial guess is that there should be less reported
                incidents during the day, and then a sharp
                increase during the night. I am making the general assumption
                that
                the cover of darkness would push more
                criminal activity to occur at night. However, it could just very
                well stay relatively constant. Let's check it out.</p>
            <div class="analysis-one">
                <figure id="data_viz_1" class="data_viz"> </figure>
                Yep....my initial guess was way off.
                <br>
                What we see instead is that there are very few reported
                incidents from 12
                AM to 5 AM. 5 AM actually sees the least amount of criminal
                activity. It then starts to build up again at 6 AM, increasing
                at the largest intervals in the entire 24 hour period. The
                activity
                tops out at the max by 10 AM, and then slowly decreases for the
                rest of the day.
                <br>
                Given these results, I can confidently conclude that my
                hypothesis
                of "more crime under the cover of darkness" wasn't actually
                true. The highest amount of criminal activity actually occurs
                during open
                daylight, at 10 AM.
                <br>
                This result actually makes sense when you synthesiz

            <h3>Sources</h3>
            The data is sourced from the Santa Clara County Open Data Portal.
            Here is the link to the dataset:

            <br>
            An interesting observation of note - this is the most popular
            dataset that is not COVID-19 related.
            I think two conclusions could be equally likely to be true. Firstly,
            SCC residents are becoming increasingly
            concerned about rising crime in the County. Or, alternatively, users
            who don't even live in the County are
            interested
            in seeing what the numbers say in order to justify their
            pre-conceived political notions about Santa Clara
            County
            or the San Francisco Bay Area in general. Or both, since the two
            sentiments are not mutually exclusive.

                in a conversational format, especially
                geared towards someone without a hard CS background. Perfect
                match for me because I want to make things
                work and not get mired up in the technicalities behind the
                library. A small problem I have is that some of the example data
                viz's are not displaying
                on my computer for some reason. I have yet to resolve the
                problem. I do try and study the
                code changes in the examples but I am a
                visual learner and not having the toy data viz's to look at
                really hurts.
